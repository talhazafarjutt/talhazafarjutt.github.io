Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate Software Engineer who thrives on the challenges of both mobile application development and backend construction. My journey in the tech world has led me to wear many hats - I've delved into the intricacies of web and mobile application development, and even navigated the complex landscape of DevOps.

Currently, I am working as a Software Engineer at [Bool Mind](https://boolmind.com/) where I'm countributing to the development of cloud-based web and mobile applications. I'm using technologies like React, React Native, Flutter, GraphQL, Node.js, and AWS to build scalable and secure applications.

Previously, I worked as Software Engineer at [9melon](https://9melons.com) where I contributed to the creation of a mobile application for a client. I worked on the development of the application's frontend using React Native and its backend using Node.js and MongoDB.

I am also working as a freelancer and have worked on a number of projects. I have developed mobile applications using React Native and Flutter. I have also worked on the development of web applications using React and Node.js. Freelancing has helped me to improve my communication skills and taught me how to work with clients.

I also developed my own mobile application using React Native. The application is available on both Google Play Store and Apple App Store. The application helped me to learn the process of building applications and creating templates for my own use and for the community.

Besides this, I also contributed to open source projects and developed a package for [react native](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-split-flap).
